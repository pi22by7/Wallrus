# Wallrus ðŸ¦­

A fast, cross-platform wallpaper management tool written in Rust. Wallrus lets you download wallpapers from Unsplash, create procedural wallpapers, and manage wallpaper slideshows across different desktop environments and window managers.

## Features

âœ¨ **Multi-Platform Support**
- Linux (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, Hyprland)
- macOS
- Windows

ðŸŽ¨ **Multiple Wallpaper Sources**
- Download from Unsplash API with keyword/artist/collection filters
- Generate procedural wallpapers (gradients, random walks, scatter plots)
- Slideshow from local image directories

ðŸªŸ **Hyprland Integration**
- Native support for hyprpaper via `hyprctl` commands
- Fallback to swww for animated wallpapers
- Basic swaybg support for simple static wallpapers

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ 
- For Unsplash downloads: [Unsplash API access key](https://unsplash.com/developers)

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wallrus.git
cd wallrus
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/wallrus`.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project directory or set environment variables:

```bash
# Required for downloading from Unsplash
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here

# Directory to save wallpapers (will be created if it doesn't exist)
IMAGE_PATH=/path/to/wallpaper/directory
```

### Hyprland Setup

Wallrus automatically detects Hyprland and tries wallpaper utilities in this order:

1. **hyprpaper** (preferred) - `hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper`
2. **swww** (fallback) - `swww img`
3. **swaybg** (basic) - `swaybg -i`

Make sure at least one of these utilities is installed:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S hyprpaper swww swaybg

# Or install manually from their respective repositories
```

## Usage

### Download Wallpapers

```bash
# Download a random nature wallpaper
wallrus download

# Search by keyword
wallrus download --keyword "mountains"

# Download from specific artist
wallrus download --artist "johndoe"

# Download from collection
wallrus download --collection "123456"
```

### Generate Wallpapers

```bash
# Generate a random procedural wallpaper
wallrus generate

# Specify dimensions (defaults to 1920x1080)
wallrus generate --width 2560 --height 1440
```

### Slideshow

```bash
# Start slideshow from directory (changes every 60 seconds)
wallrus slideshow /path/to/images

# Custom interval (in seconds)
wallrus slideshow /path/to/images --interval 30
```
