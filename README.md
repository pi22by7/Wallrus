## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project directory or set environment variables:

```bash
# Required for downloading from Unsplash
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here

# Directory to save wallpapers (will be created if it doesn't exist)
IMAGE_PATH=/path/to/wallpaper/directory
```

### Hyprland Setup

Wallrus automatically detects Hyprland and tries wallpaper utilities in this order:

1. **hyprpaper** (preferred) - `hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper`
2. **swww** (fallback) - `swww img`
3. **swaybg** (basic) - `swaybg -i`

Make sure at least one of these utilities is installed:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S hyprpaper swww swaybg

# Or install manually from their respective repositories
```

## Usage

### Download Wallpapers

```bash
# Download a random nature wallpaper
wallrus download

# Search by keyword
wallrus download --keyword "mountains"

# Download from specific artist
wallrus download --artist "johndoe"

# Download from collection
wallrus download --collection "123456"
```

### Generate Wallpapers

```bash
# Generate a random procedural wallpaper
wallrus generate

# Specify dimensions (defaults to 1920x1080)
wallrus generate --width 2560 --height 1440
```

### Slideshow

```bash
# Start slideshow from directory (changes every 60 seconds)
wallrus slideshow /path/to/images

# Custom interval (in seconds)
wallrus slideshow /path/to/images --interval 30
```
